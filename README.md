## Follow-up questions

Once you are done with the above task, we would like to hear your thoughts on how you would implement the following (API and overall technical choices, no implementation):

1. If you didn't have time to complete all the above task's items, how would you have approached them?
1. If you had more time to research the component, which source would you have used and for which aspect of the design of the component?
1. How could we implement touch screens support? Any specific aspect to pay attention to?
1. How could we make the component style engine independent (so developers can choose between SCSS, styled-components and else)?
